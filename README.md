# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge I was asked to load data from a sqlite database, use that data to format graphs, and create a flask instance to explore and display the data in a browser.

Files:

climate_starter.ipynb : in this file we connect to the database, explore the data and display some findings in the graphs.

app.py: here is where we connec to the database, write various queries to pull data, and display them in the web browser via flask.

troubleshooting was done by stack overflow, module documentation, and chatGPT.
